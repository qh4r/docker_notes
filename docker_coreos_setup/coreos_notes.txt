* for starters:
brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant 
git clone https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant.git centOS
cd centOS
vagrant up

** SystemD replaces System Init in new linux distros.
 * it allows parrarel initialization and declarations of services being dependant on others
 * it reduces overhead of init and shell
 * it is adapted in most new linux distros beside coreOS
 
 * vagrant status * lists running machines
 * vagrant ssh joins the vm
 
 sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/test.service

sudo systemctl enable /etc/systemd/system/test.service 
sudo systemctl start test.setvice

* to get some info on unit
* sudo systemctl list-units | grep test 
* better:
sudo systemctl list-units test.service
systemctl status test.service

* to list terminal logs of unit
 - journalctl -u test.service
* to follow them
 - journalctl -u -f test.service
 
 *** BETTER USE SUDO OTHERVISE COREOS ASKS FOR PASSWOR ***
 
 * AFTER APPLYING CHANGES TO SSYTEM CONFIG WE NEED TO:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart test.service

** ETCD key value store that allows to share configuration between containers
* its a key value store
etcdctl set /msg Test * sets /msg to Test

etcdctl get /msg  * would give Test

etcdctl rm /msg * removes /msg key value pair 

etcdctl cluster-health * checks cluster
