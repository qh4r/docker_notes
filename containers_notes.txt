* to dettach from container:
	Ctrl + P + Q
	
* docker stop sends sig term signal with PID 1 which will cause process to terminate once it can
* and therefor stop the container once it does

* docker kill sends kill signal with PID 1 and forces the termination

* once process with PID 1 ends container closes

- you can reattach with 
	docker attach {name or id}
	
* PID 1 is init process in unix
	* all processes are children of init process in some way (or forked)
	* killing init kills them all

* it is possible to run more then 1 process in container but it's not easy and not default

* lists all containers:
	ls -l /var/lib/docker/containers/
	
* you can not remove running container need to stop it first

- docker rm {container id} * removes container

** SIDENOTE ** creating aliases example
	alias dps="docker ps"
	
- docker inspect {image or container id }

* docker attach attaches to pid 1

* to get container Pid (pid of the proces that runs on host)
	- docker inspect {container id} | grep Pid
	
* to enter said proces (no pid 1)
	nsenter -m -u -n -p -i -t {PID} /bin/bash

* also works since docker 1.3 (?)
	docker exec -it {container name} /bin/bash
	
!!** in two above ctrl+c or exit will not cause container process to get stopped **!!
