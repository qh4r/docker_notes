** CACHE NOTE - all images are getting cached so system uses data from instructions of
** dockers that it got

* EACH  AND EVERY COMMAND IN DOCKER FILE CREATES NEW LAYER
* this means that Dockerfile.example next to this file will create 6 layers on top of
* 5 layers of ubuntu image! (Maintainer and CMD also create layers!)

** SIDE NOTES **
	in VIM:
		v - to select by character
		V - to select line
		ctrl + v - to select rectangle
		d - to cut
		y - to copy
		p - to paste after cursor
		P - to paste before cursor
** SIDE NOTES END**

* expose makes sure that given port of this image will be available for the host
* in any of the containers created from that image 
EXPOSE {port}

* to build:
docker build -t="webserver" .
* . at the end means to build in this place (root at current folder)
* to start webserver from dockerfile (given name is webserver)
docker run -d -p 80:80 webserver
* that wawy, we are maping host port 80 to docker container 
* that is running http daemon and listening on port 80 

* to create less layers it's best to combine multiple run instructions with && and \
* example is visible in webserver Dockerfile

* CMD executes at container RUNTIME
* RUN executes at container BUILD

* if we pass command to docer (using -c ) this will override any CMD instructions
** THERE CAN ONLY BE 1 CMD INSTRUCTION PER DOCKERFILE ** !!
* (only last one will be effective)

* CMD has 2 style:
	* shell form, commands get prepended by '/bin/sh -c', ex:
		CMD echo "Hello"
	* Exec Form, the one that was used so far, 
		- IT ALLOWS TO EXECUTE COMMANDS IN ANY CONTAINER
			* ALSO THOSE W/O SHELL *
		[command, ...arguments]
		ex:
		CMD ["echo", "Hello"]

* ENTRYPOINT is better for defining commands to be run at container start
* it can  not be overriden by run with -c argument!
* anything that we pass to docker run command (after docker name) is passed as an argument
* to ENTRYPOINT instruction

FROM ubuntu:15.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y iputils-ping

ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]

* such dockerfile will print anything passed ass arguments
 docker build -t="echoer" .
 * command:
 	docker run echoer test asd
 * would result in printing:
 	test asd

* however attempt to run /bin/bash for example will also be interpreted
* as text to print (in case of CMD this would override CMD)
docker run -it  echoer /bin/bash
* just prints /bin/bash

* we can have CMD pass default parameters to ENTRYPOINT
* this will give us ability to override those default params with -c

***** EXAMPLE:
Dockerfile with a tweak:

FROM ubuntu:15.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y iputils-ping

ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Hello", "Docker"]

docker build -t="echoer2" .
docker run echoer2
* prints: Hello Docker
docker run echoer2 CHANGE CHANGE
* prints: CHANGE CHANGE

***** END EXAMPLE

* !!! you can override ENTRYPOINT using --entrypoint argument !!!

* you can pass Environmental variables to container using ENV command

FROM ubuntu:15.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y iputils-ping

ENV var1=test var2=sekret

* inside this docker there are var1 and var2 env variables (can use env to see all)

* echo ${var1}  would print ->  test

*** SIDE NOTE : ${} interprets variable $() runs command !!!! ***
