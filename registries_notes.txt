* default registry is hub.docker.com
	** dockerhub only gives u 1 private repo for free **

* we need to have an image that has the name of our repo
docker tag {existing image id, ex.: 672482e8e6b8} {repo_name, ex.: qh4r/hellonode:1.0}

* before push you need to login
	docker login --username=<user username> --email=<user email address>


* to push 
	docker push {full_repo_name (in line with our docker name)}
	ex.: docker push qh4r/hellonode:1.0

* RUNNING OWN REGISTRY
* to start:
	docker run -d -p 5000:5000 registry
	
	- registry is an image that you can pull from docker ub
	- -p 5000:5000 maps container port 5000 to host port 5000
	
	
* to push to registry
docker tag 3906bf872e84 http://192.168.56.101:5000/priv-test
 - id is image that we want to push id after it is new name that should go in line with registry
 	priv-test is name that image will have on registry

docker push 192.168.56.101:5000/priv-test
	- ip is related to registry

* it is possible that https will not work in that case following does the trick (UNSAFE):

sudo service docker stop
docker daemon --insecure-registry 192.168.56.101:5000 &

* you can also edit following file:
	vim /etc/default/docker
	
* and add line:
	DOCKER_OPTS="--insecure-registry 192.168.56.101:5000"

* SECURE WAY would require setup of ssl so that docker would communicate on https

* ON CENTOS
	-	edit: 
		/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
	- 	add:
		ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker -d $OPTIONS $DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIONS 
			-- insecure-registry 192.168.56.101:5000
			
* THIS WAS OLD WAY OF REGISTRY SETUP
