* there are 2 ways of networking 
	- OLD ONE - container linking
	- NEW ONE - docker networking
	
** legacy CONTAINER LINKING
	* need to run container with a name
	  docker run -d --name test-postgres [IMAGE_NAMEd]
	
	* then we can use that name while running other container
	  docker run -d --link test-postgres:postgres [IMAGE_NAME]
	  * --link [NAME (given in --name)]:[alias - can be used in container linking]
	
	* you can link multiple containers like that
	
	
*** SIDENOTE - uou can use docker exect to execute command in RUNNING CONTAINER
	docker exec [command]
	
*** CONTAINER LINKING is not best suited for production

*** CREATING AND USING NETWORK

	docker network create --driver bridge [NETWORK_NAME]
	
	* bridge is one of available drivers

*** you can ls and rm networks and more

*** you run by:
	docker run -d --net=[NETWORK_NAME] --name [ALIAS] mongo
	
	* ALIAS IS STILL USED LIKE IT WAS IN CONTAINER LINKING
	
** You can inspect network using:
	docker network inspect [network_name]
